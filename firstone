# So, apparently you can't use "net assets or ccapital of old partnership divided by old partners' total coresponding interest" for admission by purchase?

Admission by investment:

        TAC = Total Agreed Capital:
                * Definition: the total amount of new capital established by the partners for the partnership.
                * on and on...
                * May be determined by:
                        1. Amound invested by new partner divided by his/her corresponding interest.    
                        2. Net assets or capital of old partnership divided by old partners' total corresponding interest.      
        TCC = Total Contributed Capital:
                * Definition: the total amount of capital contributed by al the partners, whether old or new, to the new partnership.
                * on and on...


        1) Find out if these exist:
                * Asset revaluation: the TAC and the TCC are compared. Any difference may give rise to an asset revalution.
                        - For simpliciy, asset revaluation is determined based on total partnership capital (wtfdtm?)
                * Bonus: the capital credited for the new partner and his/her capital contribution are compared. Any difference gives rise to a bonus. 
                        - For simplicity, bonus is determined based on new partnership capital. (wtfdtm?)
