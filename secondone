Asset revaluation (what I know so far):
	(debit side) They can choose to use these accounts?:
		Directly to the assets/liabilities (e.g. merch. inv. and accum. depr.)
		Other Assets (if indicated, please specify other assets invested)
		Non-Cash Assets	(if indicated, please specify other assets invested)

	(credit side) They can choose to use these accounts?
		Revaluation account (I'm not sure about this one, haven't encountered it yet)
		Capital adjustment account (Use to these account, then close the amount to Partners' Capital accounts)
		Partners' Capital accounts (straight to these accounts?)




Questions: 
	* # Look at your notebook
	* Who decideds the new agreed TAC? Isn't it too arbitrary (What am I doing wrong lmao)? How to prevent fraud?
		* The methods used to deterine TAC is so arbitrary?
	* Take note the difference between admission by purchase and admission by investment. Mostly in the way TAC/TCC is determined.


TAC = revaluationAmount + TCC


Asset revaluation - take note of "the big picture" because I think this also applies to "admission by purchase of interest". 
Bonus - is there a "big picture" does this apply to others too?


With regards to asset revaluation and bonuses, you cannot have both but you can have none.
