The cost method is used in accounting for treasury shares. The reason is the legal limitation on acquisition of treasury shares.


what did the book mean when it said "indirectly returning money to shareholderes (through treasury shares)"

# Scenario/experimentatoin based thinking

Test 1: Company reacquires 10 treasury shares with a par value of 5 pesos but reacquired at the price of 10 pesos.

Treasury Shares         100
        Cash                    100


Treasury Shares         50
        Cash                    50


# The par value method is not an acceptable approach because of the legal requirement that "retained earnings must be appropriated to the extent of the cost of treasury share."

No corporation shall redeem, repurchase, or reacquire its own shares, of whatever class, unless it has adequate amount of unrestricted retained earnings to support the cost
of said shares.
        * Why so?
       * Can't the cost = FMV or par value?

"If the corporation were allowed to acquire treasury shares when it has no retained earnings balance or when it has a deficit, it would be tantamount to indirectly returning capital to shareholders, which is  violation of the trust fund doctrine."



Treasury shares: you reobtain issued shares.

Scenario #1: unrestricted retained earnings < cost of shares
        You would increase your treasury shares
        You would have increase liability (e.g. A/P)

        Assets = Liabilities + Retained Earnings
        Assets = Liabilities + Share Capital + Net Income - Dividends

Scenario #2: unrestricted retained earnings > cost of shares
        Nothing happens

Scenario #3: unrestricted retained earnings =  cost of shares
        Nothing happens


Treasury shares is contra-equity account.
What is it "contra" to? Share Capital?

Legal Capital: portion of the paid-in-capital arising from issuance of share capital which cannot be returned to the shareohlders in any form during the lifetime of the corporation. Can be determined by:
        1. In the case of par valueshare legal capital is the aggregate par value of the shares issued and subscribed.
        2. In the case of no-par value share, legal capital is the total conideration received from shareholders including the excess over the stated value.
